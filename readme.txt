Easily add code to your head and/or footer, site-wide and/or on any individual page/post.

== Description ==

> **Notice**
> Average is changing its name to AddFunc. Much better, huh?! Therefore, this plugin has been republished as [AddFunc Head & Footer Code](https://wordpress.org/plugins/addfunc-head-footer-code/). The "AddFunc version" is compatible with the "Average version," so installation and activation of either or both is risk-free. This also enables you to manually transfer all of your head and footer code to the "AddFunc version" (if you wish). The "Average version" will remain available with minimal support until it becomes a burden for AddFunc (probably for many years to come, as of 2014). Any new features will only be added to the "AddFunc version," so it is of course the recommended version (at least for future projects). Thanks!

Allows admins to add code to the `<head>` and/or footer of an individual post and/or site-wide. Ideal for scripts such as Google Analytics conversion tracking code and any other general or page-specific JavaScript.

**Custom support tickets are available**
